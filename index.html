        <h4>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries <br> divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in <br> Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h4>

    <div class="subtext3">
        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. <br>We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, <br>some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared <br> belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape <br> the future of music culture.</p>

    <div class="subtext4">
        <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work <br> their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that <br> are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t <br> always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new <br> knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff- <br>organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production <br> techniques and best practices.</p>
